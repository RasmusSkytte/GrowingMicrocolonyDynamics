# GrowingMicrocolonyDynamics

Note: The raw data files for this project is quite large at ~10 GB.
As a result, these files are located at a separate repository:
https://github.com/RasmusSkytte/GrowingMicrocolonyDynamicsData

The scripts assume that you are running linux with MATLAB and imagemagick installed.

We have constructed a makefile to reproduce the data and figures.
In order, do the following:
make process                   (This requires the raw data)
make videos
make analyze
